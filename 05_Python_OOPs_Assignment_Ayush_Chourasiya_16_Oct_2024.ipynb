        "\n",
        "**Ans :-** The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python are :-\n",
        "1.  **Class:** Class is defined as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and model, and methods like start() and stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Object:** Objects are an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from it. Objects hold the actual data and the functionality that is defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only exposing a limited interface. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers like public, private, and protected attributes or methods (e.g., prefixing with underscores).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Inheritance:** It is a mechanism for creating a new class that reuses, extends, or modifies the behavior of an existing class. The new class (called a child or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Polymorphism:** The ability to use a common interface for different data types. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. In Python, this is often used with method overriding and operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "These core concepts help in designing flexible, reusable, and organized code using OOP principles."

        "\n",
        "1. **Instance Methods**\n",
        "  * **Definition:** Instance methods are the most common type of method in a class. They operate on an instance of the class (i.e., an object), and they have access to instance variables and methods.\n",
        "  * **Usage:** These methods require an instance of the class to be called and typically work with instance attributes.\n",
        "  * **Self Parameter:** Instance methods take the first parameter self, which refers to the instance calling the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class Methods**\n",
        "  * **Definition:** Class methods operate on the class itself rather than instances of the class. They are often used when you want to modify or access class-level data.\n",
        "  * **Usage:** These methods work with class variables and donâ€™t depend on instance-specific data. They can be called on the class itself or an instance of the class.\n",
        "  * **Cls Parameter:** Class methods take cls as the first parameter, which refers to the class, not the instance.\n",
        "  * **Decorator:** Class methods are marked with the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences:**\n",
        "    \n",
        "  * Instance methods are called on an instance and can access and modify instance-specific data.\n",

        "2.  **Variable-length arguments:** Using *args or **kwargs, we can accept any number of arguments.\n",

        "#### ***Q.6 Describe the five types of inheritance in Python. Provide a simple example of multiple inheritance.***\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans :-** In Python, inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class. Python supports five types of inheritance:\n",
        "1. **Single Inheritance :-** A class inherits from a single parent class.\n",
        "```\n",
        "#Example\n",
        "    class Animal:\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "        def bark(self):\n",
        "            print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. **Multiple Inheritance :-** A class inherits from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to inherit features from all parent classes.\n",
        "```\n",
        "#Example\n",
        "      class Bird:\n",
        "          def fly(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Bird flies\")\n",
        "      class Fish:\n",
        "          def swim(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Fish swims\")\n",
        "      class FlyingFish(Bird, Fish):\n",
        "          pass\n",
        "      flying_fish = FlyingFish()\n",
        "      flying_fish.fly()   # Output: Bird flies\n",
        "      flying_fish.swim()  # Output: Fish swims\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. **Multilevel Inheritance :-** A class inherits from a parent class, and another class inherits from that derived class. This forms a chain of inheritance.\n",
        "```\n",
        "#Example\n",
        "      class Animal:\n",
        "          def speak(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "      class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "          def bark(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "      class Puppy(Dog):\n",
        "          def play(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Puppy plays\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance :-** Multiple classes inherit from the same parent class.\n",
        "```\n",
        "#Example\n",
        "      class Animal:\n",
        "          def speak(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "      class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "          def bark(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "      class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "          def meow(self):\n",
        "              print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hybrid Inheritance :-** A combination of two or more types of inheritance. For example, it could be a mix of multiple and multilevel inheritance.\n",
        "```\n",
        "#Example\n",
        "      class Animal:\n",
        "          def speak(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans :-** The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a hierarchy of classes. When a method is called on an instance of a class, Python searches for that method in the class itself first, then in its parent classes, following the MRO until the method is found. This is especially important in the case of multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the C3 Linearization (C3 superclass linearization) algorithm to determine the MRO, ensuring a consistent and predictable order.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why MRO Matters**\n",
        " * It ensures that the search for methods/attributes is predictable.\n",
        " * It avoids conflicts and ambiguities, especially in complex hierarchies with multiple inheritance.\n",
        " * It guarantees that subclasses are considered before their superclasses, and left-to-right precedence is followed in multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Retrieving the MRO Programmatically :-** We can retrieve the MRO of a class in Python using either:\n",
        " * The __mro__ attribute: This returns a tuple showing the MRO of the class.\n",
        " * The mro() method: This method returns a list of classes in the MRO.\n",

        "**Ans :-** In Python, magic methods (also known as dunder methods) allow you to define how objects of a class behave with built-in functions and operators. The __str__ method is used to define a string representation of an object, which is useful when you want to print or convert an object to a string.
